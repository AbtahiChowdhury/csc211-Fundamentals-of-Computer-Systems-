# csc211: Fundamentals of Computer Systems
Introduction to computer architecture course using VHDL.

## Projects

### Project 1: String Length in Assembly
A project to get familiar with and learn how to compute string length assembly.

### Project 2: Decoders
A project to implement a 2-4 decoder and a 3-8 decoder in VHDL.

### Project 3: Latches
A project to implement a SR latch, S'R' latch, and a D latch in VHDL.

### Project 4: Sequential Circuits
A project to implement a positive edge triggered D flip flop, T flip flop, and ripple counter in VHDL.

### Project 5: Counting Multiples of 4
A project to implement a counter that only outputs a 1 when the sum of all inputs so far is a multiple of 4 in VHDL using both structural and behavioral implementations.
